# Detecting Hypoxia in Human Cells using AI

## Introduction
This repository contains the winning project of the AI lab Competition held at Bocconi University in the spring of 2023.

It consists of an end-to-end research project aimed at detecting Hypoxia in human cells using computational approaches by analyzing their gene expression profiles. 

In particular Hypoxia corresponds to a condition of insufficient oxygen supply that can lead to alteration in the expression of genes. In the context of cancer, it's observed primarily in the case of aggresive and rapidly progressing tumors that quickly out-grow their blood and thus oxygen supply. 

Collaborators: Jan Schrewe, Arianna Feliziani, Florian Daefler, Federico Russo.

## Content
The project can be summarized into three macro cathegories: 
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Supervised Learning

Furthermore it contains a technique to identify cell types using Community Detection Algorithmsa and a new feature selection approach that considerably reduces training time and mantains near optimal accuracy and much more.

We presented our work at the **Italian Bioinformatics Annual Conference** in Trento in June 2024.
